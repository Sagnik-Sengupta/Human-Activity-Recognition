# Human-Activity-Recognition

The following study aimed to compared state of the art image classification models on a custom indoor Human Activity Recognition Dataset. Main architectures compared were - Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers.

The models used along with their accuracies are:
1. ViT -
2. ResNet50 -
3. MobileNet -
4. EfficientNetB2 -
5. MobileViT -
